# Random Money Game
This is a simple Discord bot for a random money game consisting of three rounds. Each round presents the player with three chests to choose from, each containing a different amount of money. The player selects one chest per round, and the bot reveals the amount of money inside. The total amount of money accumulated across all rounds is displayed at the end.
